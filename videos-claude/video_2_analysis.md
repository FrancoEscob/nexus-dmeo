## Relevancia para Nexus

**Major Competitive Gaps Identified:**
1. **Lack of Professional Focus**: None focus on business/professional scenarios
2. **No Psychology-Aware Personalization**: All use one-size-fits-all approach
3. **Generic Feedback**: No app adapts feedback style to user anxiety levels
4. **Limited Advanced Content**: Most too basic for intermediate+ professionals

**Opportunities for Nexus:**
- **Custom lesson + Professional focus**: Combine Hablo's custom lesson with our professional scenarios
- **Better Feedback System**: Our FLCAS-based feedback adaptation beats generic corrections
- **Structure + Flow**: Learn from Hablo's balance of structure with conversation flow
- **Advanced Content**: Serve the underserved intermediate+ professional market

**Threats to Monitor:**
- **Hablo's rapid innovation**: Custom lessons on-the-fly is impressive
- **Praktika's mature feature set**: Rich app with video calls y avatars
- **ChatGPT competition**: Advanced users might skip apps for direct ChatGPT prompting

**Tactical Insights:**
- **Free trial strategy**: Apps with poor free experience don't convert (Hallo, TalkPal)
- **Feedback timing**: In-line corrections work better than post-lesson dumps
- **Structure matters**: Random conversation apps fail vs structured learning experiences
- **Voice quality threshold**: Users will tolerate imperfect voices if overall experience is strong
