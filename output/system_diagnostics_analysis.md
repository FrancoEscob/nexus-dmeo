# Context Bundle Hook System - Runtime Behavior Diagnostics Report

**Generated:** October 1, 2025
**Analysis Type:** System Runtime Behavior Analysis
**Scope:** Claude Code Hook System Performance Investigation

---

## Executive Summary

**KEY FINDING:** The context bundle hook system is **PARTIALLY WORKING** but experiencing **critical dependency failures** that compromise reliability. The system successfully creates bundle files but fails intermittently due to missing Python dependencies.

### Current Status: ⚠️ DEGRADED OPERATION
- ✅ Hook execution is triggered consistently
- ✅ JSON input processing works correctly
- ✅ Bundle file creation and writing works
- ❌ **CRITICAL FAILING POINT:** pytz dependency missing
- ❌ Error handling masks failures silently

---

## Detailed Technical Analysis

### 1. Hook Execution Status

**Observation:** The bundle hook is being called successfully and consistently.

**Evidence:**
- `/home/fran/Desktop/Language-Learning-Research2/logs/BUNDLE_ALWAYS.log` contains 148+ entries showing "BUNDLE HOOK LLAMADO EN EVENTO"
- Log entries are timestamped continuously through current session
- Hook receives valid JSON input data as shown in `raw_stdin_bundle_hook.log`

**Status:** ✅ WORKING

### 2. JSON Input Processing

**Observation:** The hook successfully receives and processes JSON input from Claude Code.

**Evidence from `raw_stdin_bundle_hook.log`:**
```json
{
  "session_id": "f88c5d63-be2f-4037-89f1-f151c0d51beb",
  "hook_event_name": "PostToolUse",
  "tool_name": "Read",
  "tool_input": {"file_path": "/path/to/file"}
}
```

**Status:** ✅ WORKING

### 3. Context Bundle File Creation

**Observation:** Bundle files ARE being created successfully despite dependency errors.

**Evidence:**
- Bundle directory exists: `/home/fran/Desktop/Language-Learning-Research2/.claude/agents/context_bundles/`
- Current active bundle: `TUE_21_f88c5d63-be2f-4037-89f1-f151c0d51beb.jsonl` (75 lines, actively updated)
- Historical bundles exist from previous sessions
- Bundle content format is correct with proper JSONL structure

**Status:** ✅ WORKING

### 4. CRITICAL FAILURE POINT: Missing pytz Dependency

**Observation:** The system fails when importing the `pytz` module required for timezone handling.

**Evidence from `hook_errors.log`:**
```
Error en bundle_hook.py: No module named 'pytz'
Error decoding JSON in bundle_hook.py: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)
Raw:
```

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Script declares `pytz` as dependency in UV script header
- UV dependency installation is failing silently
- System Python (3.11.2) doesn't have `pytz` installed globally
- When pytz import fails, the `write_to_context_bundle()` function crashes
- Error handling catches exception but exits silently (sys.exit(0))

**Status:** ❌ CRITICAL FAILURE

### 5. Environment Analysis

**UV Installation:**
- UV is properly installed at `/home/fran/.local/bin/uv`
- UV script execution works: `uv run --script .claude/hooks/bundle_hook.py`
- Debug output shows correct environment detection

**Python Environment:**
- System Python: 3.11.2 (no pytz module)
- Script requires: ">=3.8" ✅
- Dependency management via UV script headers

**File Permissions:**
- Bundle hook script: `-rwxr-xr-x` ✅
- Logs directory: `drwxr-xr-x` ✅
- Bundle files: `-rw-r--r--` ✅

**Status:** ✅ PROPERLY CONFIGURED

### 6. Error Handling Analysis

**Current Behavior:**
```python
except Exception as e:
    # log error detallado para debug
    with open("logs/hook_errors.log", "a") as f:
        f.write(f"Error en bundle_hook.py: {e}\n")
    sys.exit(0)  # ❌ Silent failure
```

**Problem:** When pytz import fails, the hook exits with code 0 (success), causing Claude Code to believe the operation succeeded when it actually failed.

**Impact:** Operations are silently dropped without any indication to the user or system.

**Status:** ❌ PROBLEMATIC DESIGN

### 7. Bundle Content Analysis

**Current Bundle (`TUE_21_f88c5d63-be2f-4037-89f1-f151c0d51beb.jsonl`):**
- **75 operations recorded**
- **Operations captured:** read, write, bash, todowrite, glob, websearch, webfetch
- **File timestamps:** Shows continuous updates through current session
- **Format:** Correct JSONL with proper operation tracking

**Missing Operations Analysis:**
Based on bundle content, some operations are being captured successfully, suggesting the pytz failure is intermittent or affects specific execution paths.

**Status:** ✅ CONTENT FORMAT CORRECT

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: UV Dependency Resolution Failure

**The core problem is that UV is not properly installing the `pytz` dependency** despite it being declared in the script header.

**Why this happens:**
1. UV script execution may be falling back to system Python
2. Dependency installation might be failing silently
3. Virtual environment creation could be failing
4. UV caching issues or version conflicts

### Secondary Issue: Silent Error Handling

**The hook system fails silently** due to `sys.exit(0)` in the exception handler, making debugging extremely difficult.

---

## Technical Recommendations

### IMMEDIATE FIXES (Priority 1)

#### 1. Fix UV Dependency Installation
```bash
# Test UV dependency resolution
uv add pytz --script .claude/hooks/bundle_hook.py

# Alternative: Install pytz globally
pip install pytz

# Or update script to use built-in datetime zone handling
```

#### 2. Fix Error Handling
Change line 106 in `bundle_hook.py`:
```python
# FROM:
sys.exit(0)

# TO:
sys.exit(1)  # Proper failure code
```

#### 3. Add Dependency Check at Startup
Add at beginning of `main()` function:
```python
try:
    import pytz
except ImportError:
    print("ERROR: pytz dependency not available. Install with: uv add pytz", file=sys.stderr)
    sys.exit(1)
```

### IMPROVEMENTS (Priority 2)

#### 1. Enhanced Logging
- Add timestamps to all log entries
- Include session_id in error logs
- Add success/failure counters

#### 2. Dependency Management
- Consider using `zoneinfo` (Python 3.9+) instead of pytz
- Add health check function for dependencies
- Implement graceful fallback for timezone handling

#### 3. Error Recovery
- Add retry logic for transient failures
- Implement queue for failed operations
- Add bundle validation after writes

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Issues
1. **Data Loss:** Silent failures mean operations are not being recorded
2. **System Reliability:** Intermittent failures undermine system trustworthiness
3. **Debugging Difficulty:** Silent failures mask root causes

### Medium Risk Issues
1. **Performance:** UV dependency resolution overhead
2. **Maintenance:** Complex dependency management setup

### Low Risk Issues
1. **File Permissions:** Current permissions are adequate
2. **Disk Space:** Bundle files are small and efficient

---

## Testing Verification

### Successful Tests Performed:
- ✅ Hook script execution with UV
- ✅ JSON input parsing and processing
- ✅ Bundle file creation and writing
- ✅ File permissions validation
- ✅ Environment detection
- ✅ Bundle content analysis

### Failed Tests:
- ❌ pytz module import (system Python)
- ❌ Dependency installation via UV script header

### Recommended Additional Tests:
1. UV dependency resolution testing
2. Hook failure simulation
3. Bundle corruption recovery
4. Performance testing under load

---

## Conclusion

The context bundle hook system is **functioning but compromised**. The core mechanism works correctly - hooks are triggered, JSON is processed, and bundles are created. However, the missing `pytz` dependency causes intermittent failures that are silently ignored, leading to data loss.

**This is NOT a Claude Code v2.0 compatibility issue** but rather a local environment dependency resolution problem.

The system will work reliably once the UV dependency issue is resolved and error handling is improved to surface failures rather than hiding them.

---

## Immediate Action Plan

1. **Install pytz dependency:** `uv add pytz --script .claude/hooks/bundle_hook.py`
2. **Fix error handling:** Change exit code to 1 on failures
3. **Add dependency validation:** Check imports at startup
4. **Test thoroughly:** Verify bundle creation works consistently
5. **Monitor logs:** Watch for any new error patterns

**Estimated Time to Fix:** 15-30 minutes
**Risk Level:** Low (changes are non-breaking)
**Impact:** High (will restore full functionality)
