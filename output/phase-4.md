# Phase 4: Component Refactoring and Conversion Funnel Report

## Changes Made

- **Responsive Polish**:
  - Updated demo/page.tsx layout: Padding responsive (p-4 sm:p-8).
  - Scores: Grid responsive (grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3) for stacking on small screens.
  - Buttons: Ensured touch targets >=44px (py-3/py-4, min-h-[44px]).
  - Insights: Retained scrollable, touch-friendly expand (full-width buttons).
  - Landing page: Already responsive (lg:grid-cols-2).

- **Floating Conversion Modal**:
  - Created ConversionModal.tsx using @radix-ui/react-dialog.
  - Premium styling: Glassmorphism (bg-white/10 backdrop-blur-sm border-gold/20), navy text, gold accents.
  - Trigger: Auto-opens 2s after insights display (useEffect).
  - Content: English copy - Headline \"These Insights Are Just the Start\", body targeting pros, email form (glass input, gold submit), success message.
  - Functionality: Simulated POST to /api/waitlist, closeable via X button.
  - Responsive: Centered, max-w-md, full-width on small screens.

- **Integration**: Added <ConversionModal open={modalOpen} /> post-InsightsSection in demo/page.tsx.

## UX Enhancements
- Improved mobile flow: Stacked elements, larger taps.
- Conversion optimization: Timely modal interrupts post-value delivery.
- Preserved Azure mock integration and animations.
