## Changes Made

- **Created src/app/demo/page.tsx**: 
  - Integrated AudioRecorder component for mock recording.
  - Score circles for prosody, accuracy, fluency with gold borders and Framer Motion spring animations on load.
  - Replaced hypothetical ErrorCard with InsightsSection.

- **New Components**:
  - **AudioRecorder.tsx**: Basic MediaRecorder implementation for 5s audio capture. Styled with gold CTA.
  - **ScoreCircle.tsx**: Animated circular score displays using framer-motion (scale in).
  - **InsightsSection.tsx**: Framer Motion-powered accordion for top 4 errors (priority: prosody > accuracy > fluency > completeness).
    - Collapsed: Header with accuracy % and English tease (e.g., \"'r' in 'record' (Accuracy: 66%)\" + \"Subtle Spanish influence hesitation.\").
    - Expanded: Explanation (Azure insights translated to English), Impact on professional communication, Full mock Azure data (phonemes, timing), 3-step fix with practice tips.
    - Animations: Smooth expand/collapse with AnimatePresence, hover scale.
    - Mobile: Touch-friendly buttons, scrollable max-height on sm screens (80vh), full on larger.

- **Mock Data**: Simulated Azure JSON parsing with 4 prioritized errors, preserving functionality flow (record > analyze > insights).
