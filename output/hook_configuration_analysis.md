# Claude Code v2.0 Hook Configuration Analysis Report

**Date:** October 1, 2025
**Project:** Language-Learning-Research2
**Branch:** redesign-premium-ux
**Analyst:** Hook Configuration Analyzer

---

## Executive Summary

The context bundle hook system is **partially functional** but has one critical dependency issue preventing full operation. The hook configuration structure is correct and compatible with Claude Code v2.0, but the bundle hook script fails due to a missing `pytz` dependency.

## 1. Configuration Structure Analysis

### 1.1 settings.json Hook Configuration

**Location:** `/home/fran/Desktop/Language-Learning-Research2/.claude/settings.json`

The hook configuration follows the correct Claude Code v2.0 structure:

```json
"hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [...],
    "UserPromptSubmit": [...],
    "PreToolUse": [...],
    "PostToolUse": [...],
    "Notification": [...],
    "Stop": [...],
    "SubagentStop": [...],
    "PreCompact": [...]
}
```

**✅ STRUCTURE IS CORRECT:** The event names and hook structure are compatible with Claude Code v2.0.

### 1.2 Hook Command Syntax

All hooks use the proper command format:
```json
{
    "type": "command",
    "command": "uv run .claude/hooks/[script_name].py"
}
```

**✅ SYNTAX IS CORRECT:** The `uv run` prefix and script paths are properly formatted.

### 1.3 Event Name Compatibility

The following event names are configured:
- `SessionStart` ✅
- `UserPromptSubmit` ✅
- `PreToolUse` ✅
- `PostToolUse` ✅
- `Notification` ✅
- `Stop` ✅
- `SubagentStop` ✅
- `PreCompact` ✅

**✅ EVENT NAMES ARE VALID:** All event names match Claude Code v2.0 specifications.

## 2. Bundle Hook Script Analysis

### 2.1 Script Overview

**Location:** `/home/fran/Desktop/Language-Learning-Research2/.claude/hooks/bundle_hook.py`

The script is designed to:
1. Capture context from various hook events
2. Store context in structured JSONL format
3. Organize by session and time
4. Handle different event types (UserPromptSubmit, PostToolUse)

### 2.2 Script Execution Analysis

**✅ Script is executable:** Permissions are correct (`-rwxr-xr-x`)
**✅ Script is being called:** Evidence from `BUNDLE_ALWAYS.log` shows regular execution
**✅ JSON parsing works:** Input is being successfully decoded from stdin
**✅ File paths are valid:** Context bundles are being created successfully

### 2.3 Working Features

From the logs, the hook successfully:
- Receives JSON input from Claude Code
- Parses session information correctly
- Creates context bundle files in `.claude/agents/context_bundles/`
- Handles multiple event types
- Generates properly formatted filenames (e.g., `TUE_21_f88c5d63-be2f-4037-89f1-f151c0d51beb.jsonl`)

**Evidence of successful operation:**
- Context bundle files exist and contain data
- Regular entries in `BUNDLE_ALWAYS.log`
- Successful JSON parsing in `raw_stdin_bundle_hook.log`

## 3. Critical Issues Identified

### 3.1 Primary Issue: Missing `pytz` Dependency

**Error:** `Error en bundle_hook.py: No module named 'pytz'`

**Location:** Line 22 in `bundle_hook.py`
```python
import pytz  # FAILS HERE
```

**Impact:** While the hook continues to execute, the timezone functionality fails, causing the script to exit early for events that require timezone processing.

### 3.2 Root Cause Analysis

The script declares `pytz` as a dependency in the script header:
```python
# /// script
# requires-python = ">=3.8"
# dependencies = [
#     "pytz",
# ]
# ///
```

However, the dependency is not being installed automatically by `uv run`.

## 4. Comparative Analysis with Working Hooks

### 4.1 Working Hook Example: `pre_tool_use.py`

- **Python version:** `>=3.8` ✅
- **Dependencies:** None (only standard library) ✅
- **Execution:** Works perfectly

### 4.2 Working Hook Example: `user_prompt_submit.py`

- **Python version:** `>=3.11` ✅
- **Dependencies:** `python-dotenv` (with try/catch fallback) ✅
- **Execution:** Works perfectly

### 4.3 Bundle Hook Differences

- **Python version:** `>=3.8` ✅
- **Dependencies:** `pytz` (no fallback handling) ❌
- **Execution:** Partially works, fails on timezone operations

## 5. File System Analysis

### 5.1 Permissions Check

All hook files have correct executable permissions:
```bash
-rwxr-xr-x 1 fran fran 4585 Sep 24 05:42 bundle_hook.py
-rwxr-xr-x 1 fran fran 3712 Sep 24 02:54 notification.py
-rwxr-xr-x 1 fran fran 4066 Sep 18 15:24 pre_compact.py
```

### 5.2 Directory Structure

Required directories exist and are accessible:
```
.claude/
├── hooks/ (all scripts executable)
├── agents/
│   └── context_bundles/ (bundle files being created)
└── settings.json (properly formatted)

logs/ (all log files being written successfully)
```

## 6. Input/Output Analysis

### 6.1 Input Format

The hook receives properly formatted JSON from Claude Code:
```json
{
    "session_id": "f88c5d63-be2f-4037-89f1-f151c0d51beb",
    "hook_event_name": "PostToolUse",
    "tool_name": "Read",
    "tool_input": {...},
    "tool_response": {...}
}
```

### 6.2 Output Format

The hook successfully creates JSONL files with structured context data:
```
{"operation": "read", "file_path": "/path/to/file"}
{"operation": "bash", "command": "ls -la"}
{"operation": "edit", "file_path": "/path/to/edited/file"}
```

## 7. Compatibility Assessment

### 7.1 Claude Code v2.0 Compatibility

**✅ FULLY COMPATIBLE:** The hook configuration structure and event names are correct for Claude Code v2.0.

### 7.2 Python Environment Compatibility

**⚠️ PARTIALLY COMPATIBLE:** The script works with Python 3.8+ but has a dependency issue.

## 8. Specific Recommendations

### 8.1 IMMEDIATE FIX REQUIRED

**Issue:** Missing `pytz` dependency

**Solution Options:**
1. **Install pytz globally:** `uv add pytz` or `pip install pytz`
2. **Modify script to use built-in datetime:** Replace `pytz` with Python's built-in timezone handling
3. **Add dependency fallback:** Wrap `pytz` import in try/catch like other hooks

**Recommended Approach:** Option 2 (use built-in datetime) for better compatibility and fewer external dependencies.

### 8.2 Configuration Improvements

**No changes needed:** The current configuration is correct and follows Claude Code v2.0 best practices.

### 8.3 Error Handling Improvements

**Recommendation:** Add better error handling for missing dependencies, similar to `user_prompt_submit.py`:
```python
try:
    import pytz
    TIMEZONE_AVAILABLE = True
except ImportError:
    TIMEZONE_AVAILABLE = False
    # Fallback to UTC or system time
```

## 9. Risk Assessment

### 9.1 Current Risk Level: **MEDIUM**

**Why not HIGH:** The hook is partially functional and continues to execute, creating context bundles successfully.

**Why not LOW:** The timezone functionality is broken, which affects the filename generation and timestamp accuracy.

### 9.2 Impact Analysis

**Current Impact:**
- Context bundles are being created successfully ✅
- Timezone-based naming may fail ❌
- Some events may not be properly processed ❌

**Potential Impact if not fixed:**
- Inconsistent session tracking
- Missing context data for certain events
- File naming conflicts

## 10. Conclusion

The context bundle hook system is **well-configured and mostly functional**. The configuration structure is correct for Claude Code v2.0, and the script logic is sound. The only significant issue is the missing `pytz` dependency, which prevents full functionality.

**Priority:** HIGH - Fix the dependency issue to restore full functionality

**Effort:** LOW - Simple dependency fix or code modification

**Risk:** LOW - The change is straightforward and won't affect other functionality
